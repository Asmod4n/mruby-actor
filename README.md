# mruby-actor
Breaking changes
================
The api has been rewritten, more to come.


Preliminary
===========
mruby-actor is a library to bring distributed concurrency to mruby with the [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model).
If you just need local threading based on the actor model for mruby take a look at [mruby-zmq](https://github.com/Asmod4n/mruby-zmq)

Prerequirements
===============
You need to have [libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq) with draft methods and [zyre](https://github.com/zeromq/zyre) installed on your system

Blocking operations
===================
Blocking operations must be avoided at all costs. If you really need to block a mrb context do so in a ZMQ::Thread.

Security
========
All communication between mruby actors is encrypted, except the Service Discovery based on [zyre](https://github.com/zeromq/zyre), feel free to add a PR for it at zyre.

Examples
========
```ruby
server_keypair = LibZMQ.curve_keypair
client_keypair = LibZMQ.curve_keypair
actor = Actor.new(auth: {class: ZMQ::Zap::Authenticator}, remote_server_endpoint: "tcp://en0:*", server_keypair: server_keypair)
actor2 = Actor.new(auth: {class: ZMQ::Zap::Authenticator}, client_keypair: client_keypair)
actor3 = Actor.new(auth: {class: ZMQ::Zap::Authenticator, args: ["hallo", "actor"]})
actor4 = Actor.new(auth: {class: ZMQ::Zap::Authenticator})
# if you are on Windows, the only mandatory option is the remote_server_endpoint, it must be something that works locally and from other hosts it wants to interact with. Else it automatically picks the first running network interface it can find and binds to a random port.
# Take a look at http://api.zeromq.org/master:zmq-bind which endpoints are available in zmq, wildcard tcp ports are supported
# the inproc transport isn't supported by design, each actor runs in a seperate zmq context, inproc sockets can only communicate in their own zmq context.
sleep 1 # requires conf.gem mgem: 'mruby-sleep' in your build_config.rb
string = actor.remote_new(actor.remote_actors.sample[:peerid], String, "hallo")
string.async(:upcase!)
string.send(:to_str)
string.to_str
```
